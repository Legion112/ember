---

An ember, not a furnace: nodes are meant to live for minutes, and nothing ember
creates is reachable from the internet.

```
ember up --provider runpod --gpu rtx4090 \
         --image ghcr.io/example/comfyui:v0.3.1 \
         --port comfyui:8188 --ttl 30m
```

That rents a node, waits for it, forwards `8188` to `127.0.0.1:8188` over SSH,
waits for you to finish, fetches the outputs and destroys the node — including
when you interrupt it.

## Why

Renting is roughly two orders of magnitude cheaper than owning while you are
still finding out what you need. An RTX PRO 6000 costs about 2.23M ₽ to buy and
about 134 ₽/hour to rent: at four hours a day that is an eleven-year payback,
and the card will be obsolete long before. ember exists to make the rented path
convenient enough that buying hardware becomes a decision backed by
measurements instead of by spec sheets.

## Status

`ember up --provider local` works end to end today: it rents a container on
your own Docker daemon, authenticates against a host key ember minted and
injected, forwards the ports you asked for to loopback, holds them, and
destroys the node — including after Ctrl-C.

```
make docker-build
ember up --provider local --image ghcr.io/example/wl:v1 --port demo:8188 --ttl 30m
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `internal/node` | domain core — nodes, offers, specs, integer money, states |
| `internal/loopback` | the only listener in the program, provably loopback |
| `internal/hostkey` | sealed trust — `InsecureIgnoreHostKey` cannot be typed in |
| `internal/exposure` | what may face the internet — a public port cannot be spelled |
| `internal/keys` | the operator's SSH identity, agent fallback |
| `internal/tunnel` + `sshdial` | the forward and the one place a host-key callback is set |
| `internal/provider` + `local` | provider seam and the free Docker-backed one |
| `internal/provision` | rent, wait, hold, destroy — with the money discipline |
| `internal/statestore` | the journal that makes an orphan findable |
| `internal/reconcile` | pure scan over providers and records — what `ls` and `reap` act on |
| `internal/session`, `internal/config`, `internal/cli` | wiring |

Every verb is implemented: `up`, `down`, `ls`, `reap`, `offers`, `version`.
`ls` asks every provider rather than trusting the local records, and exits 2
when anything needs attention — including a provider it could not reach.

Next: RunPod, then Vast.ai. See `AGENTS.md` for the rules all of it is
written against.

## Two properties that outrank features

**Nothing is reachable from the internet.** Every forwarded port binds to
loopback on your machine; the only thing a provider exposes publicly is sshd,
key-only, verified against a host key ember generated and injected itself.
`net.Listen` appears in exactly one package and a test fails the build if that
changes. A public port cannot be *spelled*: the type carrying one has no
exported field, so `exposure.SSHPort()` is the only thing in the program that
can produce one. After create, ember reads back what the provider says it
published and destroys the node if that is anything but sshd — on RunPod a port
declared `8188/http` is served at `{id}-8188.proxy.runpod.net` with no
authentication at all.

**A leaked node costs real money.** An orphaned H100 burns about 175 ₽/hour in
silence. Every node carries a deadline enforced in several independent places,
destroy runs on a context that survives Ctrl-C, and `ember ls` exits non-zero
when any provider could not be reached — because "I could not check" must
never look like "nothing is running". Each record also names the process
holding its node, so a run killed with `SIGKILL` is reported as billing with
nobody watching instead of printing `ok`.

## Build

```
make            # fmt, vet, test, build
make test       # unit tests, race detector, no Docker or network needed
make lint
make cover-check
make test-integration   # Docker labs; needs a working Docker daemon
```

The labs run the real `ember` binary against a real Docker daemon: a real
sshd, a real SSH handshake against a pinned host key, a real forward, and a
`SIGKILL` mid-provision to produce the orphan that `ls` and `reap` exist to
find. Nothing in them skips — a missing daemon or image is a hard failure
naming the command that fixes it, because a lab that skips itself reports
success for a security control that never ran.

Go 1.27. The Makefile prefers `~/sdk/go1.27.0` when present so the compiler
cannot drift from what `go.mod` declares.

## Configuration

`ember.yaml` holds image names, GPU filters, ports and budgets, and is safe to
commit. Credentials are not in it: they come from the environment
(`RUNPOD_API_KEY`, `VAST_API_KEY`) or from `~/.config/ember/credentials.yaml`
with mode 0600. Nothing secret is ever passed as a command-line flag, because
`/proc/<pid>/cmdline` is world-readable.
